# HTML & CSS

## Session 1

I had you all sign up to [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com) and start on the ["Making a Website"](http://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website/) task.

You can access [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com) from anywhere, all you need is a computer with an internet connection. You don't need to visit the New Media computer suite to continue with your learning.

### Using Codecademy

#### Join the Class
Firstly, can you all login to Codecademy and then visit the [homepage](http://codecademy.com). At the top, you should see a green bar saying *"Teacher Jason Hobbs has invited you to join class MA New Media. __Accept__ or __Decline__"*...click __Accept__.

#### Working through tasks

When you believe you have completed a section, please make sure you click the blue *"Save & Submit Code"* button at the bottom. If you're correct, it'll turn green and point you to the next section. If not, it'll turn red and tell you what's wrong.

## Session 1 Homework

If you didn't finish the *"Making a Website"* task, I'd urge that you continue with it in your own time. To make sure you fully understand HTML/CSS, I'd recommend that you then do the ["HTML / CSS"](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web) task. It's like the *"Making a Website"* task, but it covers the topic in a lot more detail.

Once you're comfortable with HTML/CSS, I'd suggest you move onto the ["Make an Interactive Website"](http://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-an-interactive-website/), which covers JavaScript / jQuery. To make sure you fully understand this topic, I'd recommend the [JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript) and [jQuery](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery) tasks.

## Session 2

We will be continuing with the Codecademy tasks. Before this second session, I am expecting you all to have complete:

* ["Making a Website"](http://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website/)
* ["HTML / CSS"](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web)
* ["Make an Interactive Website"](http://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-an-interactive-website/)
